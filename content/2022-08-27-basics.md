## algebra

A _binary operation_ on a set $S$ is a pairwise operation $S x S -> S$. The set is $closed$ under the operation.

A _semigroup_ is a set of elements and an associative binary operation operating on the set.

A _monoid_ is a semigroup with an identity element.

A _group_ is a set of monoid such that for each element there exists an inverse element

A _commutative group_ (also known as an _abelian group_) is a group whose operation is commutative.

A _ring_ is a set of elements and two binary operations $(+)$ and $(\cdot)$ such that:

- it forms an abelian group under $(+)$
- it forms a monoid under $(\cdot)$
- $(\cdot)$ distributes over $(+)$

A _field_ is a ring such that:

- for each nonzero element (where $0$ is the additive identity) there exists an inverse element
- $(\cdot)$ is commutative

The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are the cannonical example of a ring. The integers are not a field because some inverses are not contained in the set (e.g. 1/5).

## topology

A _topological space_ is a set such that:

there are multiple equivalent definitions
