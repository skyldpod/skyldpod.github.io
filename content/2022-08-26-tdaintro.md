Topological Data Analysis (TDA) encompasses a variety of techniques which ["connect the dots"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07036), thereby creating shapes whose topology can be understood. As a simple example, we can cover each of the dots in a point cloud with a circle of a given radius. As we increase that radius, we'll produce a shape with fewer and fewer "holes" until we're left with a mass with no holes. When the radii are too small to overlap, we gain no additional information. When the radii are large enough to encompass the entire point cloud, we loose all information. TDA aims to find the sweet-spot radius that will provide useful information about our data.

In practice, most interesting datasets are complex enough that the radius technique (described above) [falls short](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/lesnick-topological-data-analysis). It doesn't provide a rigorous way to determine which radius creates a topological space that best represents the underlying data. Additionally, it doesn't distinguish between major and minor features in the data. As a result, mathematicians have developed more advanced analysis techniques. One such technique is persistent homology whose core idea is to examine how the topological space changes as the radius changes. This approach smooths over noise in the data, as geometric structures created by noise will disappear quickly as the radius changes, while the structures created by the signal will be long-lived.
