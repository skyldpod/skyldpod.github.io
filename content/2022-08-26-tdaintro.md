Topological Data Analysis (TDA) encompasses a variety of techniques which ["connect the dots"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07036), thereby creating shapes whose topology can be understood. As a simple example, we can cover each of the dots in a point cloud with a circle of a given radius. As we increase that radius, we'll produce a shape with fewer and fewer "holes" until we're left with a mass with no holes. When the radii are too small to overlap, we gain no additional information. When the radii are large enough to encompass the entire point cloud, we loose all information. TDA aims to find the sweet-spot radius that will provide useful information about our data.

In practice, most interesting datasets are complex enough that the radius technique (described above) [falls short](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/lesnick-topological-data-analysis). It doesn't provide a rigorous way to determine which radius creates a topological space that best represents the underlying data. Additionally, it doesn't distinguish between major and minor features in the data. As a result, mathematicians have developed more advanced analysis techniques. One such technique is persistent homology whose core idea is to examine how the topological space changes as the radius changes. This approach smooths over noise in the data, as geometric structures created by noise will disappear quickly as the radius changes, while the structures created by the signal will be long-lived. 

[Distance](https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/5196/6089) is implicit in our discussion of radii. Said differently, in order to be able to draw circles of a given radius around points, we need to have defined a way to measure the length of a line originating from any point in the data. (As a philosophical aside, is this actually the same as being able to measure the distance _between_ two points?) Thus we will always often to use a well-defined distance as we explore data topologically.

To more formally study the geometric shape of data, we use simplicial complexes. For an $n$-dimensional set of data points, we can connect any two points with a line, connect any three points with a plane, connect any four points with a solid, and so on. Any $n$ points comprise a simplex, which is a generalization of a line to a triangle to a tetrahedron to a 5-cell to a something even harder to visualize. A collection of simplices is a simplicial complex $K$ if:

1. every face of a simplex in $K$ is in $K$
2. every intersection of simplices $A$ and $B$ in $K$ is a face of both $A$ and $B$

Counterexample to 1 (but not to 2): The single set $X = { triangle }$ consisting of together three points, the lines that connects them, and the area inside is not a simplicial complex because each of the three lines (faces) is not a member of $X$.

Counterexample to 2 (but not to 1): Hmm.

Failed counterexample to 2: (I was intersecting complexes and not simplices.) Complex $A$: Draw four points; draw a line connecting one point $c$ to the other three $x$, $y$, $z$. Complex $B$: Draw a fifth point $w$; draw a line connecting $c$ and $w$; draw a line connecting $x$ to $c$ and connecting $y$ to $z$. The intersection $A \intersect B$ consists of $c$, $y$, $z$ and the two connecting lines.

We can now construct an interesting simplicial complex: the Vietoris-Rips complex. Given a dataset consisting of $n$-dimensional points, a metric (so we have distance), and a fixed value $\delta > 0$, connect all pairs of points that are within $\delta$ of each other. Whenever three or more points are connected, we additionally include the higher-dimensional simplex thus created. The collection of all such simplices is the Vietoris-Rips complex. By construction, requirement 1 is satisfied. I need to think about requirement 2 more.
