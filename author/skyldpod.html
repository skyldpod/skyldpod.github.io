        <!--<div class="entry-content"> <h2>algebra</h2>
<p>A <em>binary operation</em> on a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a pairwise operation <span class="math">\(S \times S \rightarrow S\)</span>. The set is <em>closed</em> under the operation.</p>
<p>A <em>semigroup</em> is a set of elements and an associative binary operation operating on the set.</p>
<p>A <em>monoid</em> is a semigroup with an identity element.</p>
<p>A <em>group</em> is a set of monoid such that for each element there exists an inverse element</p>
<p>A <em>commutative group</em> (also known as an <em>abelian group</em>) is a group whose operation is commutative.</p>
<p>A <em>ring</em> is a set of elements and two binary operations <span class="math">\((+)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((\times)\)</span> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it forms an abelian group under <span class="math">\((+)\)</span></li>
<li>it forms a monoid under <span class="math">\((\times)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\((\times)\)</span> distributes over <span class="math">\((+)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>field</em> is a ring such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>for each nonzero element (where <span class="math">\(0\)</span> is the additive identity) there exists an inverse element</li>
<li><span class="math">\((\times)\)</span> is commutative</li>
</ul>
<p>The integers <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> are the cannonical example of a ring. The integers are not a field because some inverses are not contained in the set (e.g. 1/5).</p>
<h2>topology</h2>
<p>A <em>topological space</em> is a set equipped with a <em>topology</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>topology</em> <span class="math">\(T\)</span> on a set <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is a collection of subsets of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the empty set and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> are elements of <span class="math">\(T\)</span></li>
<li>arbitrary unions are elements of <span class="math">\(T\)</span></li>
<li>finite intersections are elements of <span class="math">\(T\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The elements of <span class="math">\(T\)</span> are defined to be <em>open sets</em>. A subset that is a complement of a closed set is an <em>open set</em>.</p>
<p>Why are the intersections finite and not arbitrary? How do we fit a counterexample into the frame of the subset definition?</p>
<p>Using De Morgan's laws for set complements (union of complements is complement of intersection; intersection of complements is complement of union), we can rewrite these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>the empty set and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> are closed</li>
<li>the arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed (i.e. the complement of the arbitrary intersection of closed sets is open)</li>
<li>the finite union of closed sets is closed (i.e. the complement of the finite union of closed sets is open)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a definition based on neighborhoods of points.</p>
<h2>category theory</h2>
<p>A <em>category</em> consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a collection of objects</li>
<li>for each pair of objects, a collection of morphisms (arrows) from one to the other</li>
<li>for each pair of compatible morphisms, a binary operation called composition</li>
</ul>
<p>such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <span class="math">\(u: a \rightarrow b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v: b \rightarrow c\)</span> then there is a morphism <span class="math">\(u \circle v: a \rightarrow c\)</span></li>
<li>composition of morphisms is associative</li>
<li>for each object <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, there is an identity morphism <span class="math">\(I_a\)</span> such that for any morphism <span class="math">\(u: a \rightarrow b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(I_a \circle u = u \circle I_b = u\)</span> </li>
</ul>

        <!--<div class="entry-content"> <h3>summary</h3>
<p>Start with some points. Determine a rule for incrementally connecting more and more of the points with lines, planes, solids, and so on. As points become connected, geometric structure emerges. As even more points become connected, geometric structure disappears. We quantify this structure, group it into classes, and observe when each class is born and dies. Lastly we compare the birth-death plots of various datasets to determine if the datasets share underlying structural similarities.</p>
<h3>more-detailed-but-still-high-level summary</h3>
<p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) encompasses a variety of techniques which <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07036">"connect the dots"</a>, thereby creating shapes whose topology can be understood. As a simple example, we can cover each of the dots in a point cloud with a circle of a given radius. As we increase that radius, we'll produce a shape with fewer and fewer "holes" until we're left with a mass with no holes. When the radii are too small to overlap, we gain no additional information. When the radii are large enough to encompass the entire point cloud, we loose all information. TDA aims to find the sweet-spot radius that will provide useful information about our data.</p>
<p>In practice, most interesting datasets are complex enough that the radius technique (described above) <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/lesnick-topological-data-analysis">falls short</a>. It doesn't provide a rigorous way to determine which radius creates a topological space that best represents the underlying data. Additionally, it doesn't distinguish between major and minor features in the data. As a result, mathematicians have developed more advanced analysis techniques. One such technique is persistent homology whose core idea is to examine how the topological space changes as the radius changes. This approach smooths over noise in the data, as geometric structures created by noise will disappear quickly as the radius changes, while the structures created by the signal will be long-lived. </p>
<p><a href="https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/view/5196/6089">Distance</a> is implicit in our discussion of radii. Said differently, in order to be able to draw circles of a given radius around points, we need to have defined a way to measure the length of a line originating from any point in the data. (As a philosophical aside, is this actually the same as being able to measure the distance <em>between</em> two points?) Thus we will always often to use a well-defined distance as we explore data topologically.</p>
<p>To more formally study the geometric shape of data, we use simplicial complexes. For an <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional set of data points, we can connect any two points with a line, connect any three points with a plane, connect any four points with a solid, and so on. Any <span class="math">\(n\)</span> points comprise a simplex, which is a generalization of a line to a triangle to a tetrahedron to a 5-cell to a something even harder to visualize. A collection of simplices is a simplicial complex <span class="math">\(K\)</span> if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every face of a simplex in <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(K\)</span></li>
<li>Every intersection of simplices <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> in <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is a face of both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Counterexample to 1</em> (but not to 2): The singleton set <span class="math">\(X = \{ triangle \}\)</span> consisting of three points, the lines that connects them, and the area inside is not a simplicial complex because each of the three lines (faces) is not a member of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Counterexample to 2</em> (but not to 1): Draw four points in a square. Draw two lines connecting the points diagonal from each other (you've drawn an "X"). Each line is a simplex. Their intersection (at the center of the square) is not a face of either simplex.</p>
<p><em>Failed Counterexample to 2</em>: (I was intersecting complexes and not simplices.) Complex <span class="math">\(A\)</span>: Draw four points; draw a line connecting one point <span class="math">\(c\)</span> to the other three <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. Complex <span class="math">\(B\)</span>: Draw a fifth point <span class="math">\(w\)</span>; draw a line connecting <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w\)</span>; draw a line connecting <span class="math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and connecting <span class="math">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. The intersection <span class="math">\(A \cap B\)</span> consists of <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math">\(z\)</span> and the two connecting lines.</p>
<p>We can now construct an interesting simplicial complex: the Vietoris-Rips complex. Given a dataset consisting of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional points, a metric (so we have distance), and a fixed value <span class="math">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span>, connect all pairs of points that are within <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> of each other. Whenever three or more points are connected, we additionally include the higher-dimensional simplex thus created. The collection of all such simplices is the Vietoris-Rips complex. By construction, requirements 1 and 2 are satisfied. (The proof for 2 probably uses triangle inequality: the intersection has to be within <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> and therefore we'd already have connected the dots.)</p>
<p>How do we determine which value(s) of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> create a complex that exhibits the underlying geometric structure of the data? We use persistence diagrams. A persistence diagram illustrates which topological features of a dataset persist as <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> varies. In particular, we consider the homology of the complex as <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> varies. Homology provides us with a formalized way to quantify the shape of a space in each dimension. For example, a solid torus has, modulo homotopy smooshing, one point, two loops, and one void. These values are called Betti numbers. They represent equivalence classes of points, loops, and voids.</p>
<p>We are still on our way to understanding the persistence diagram. Let's consider all the classes of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional "loops". As <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> increases from 0, classes will emerge and classes will disappear. The <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> value for which a class emerges is called its birth value <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and the <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> value for which a class disappears is called its death value <span class="math">\(d\)</span>. For each class, we have a tuple <span class="math">\((b,d)\)</span>. What can we do with tuples? Graph them! This graph is the persistence diagram. Traditionally <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is plotted on the horizontal axis and <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is plotted on the vertical axis. The further a point is from the line <span class="math">\(y=x\)</span>, the longer it persists. Thus the data's noise lives near the diagonal and the data's signal lives above the diagonal (for many applications).</p>
<p>Now that we have a handful (or maybe many more!) of significant <span class="math">\((b,d)\)</span> pairs for a given dataset, we can compare two datasets to determine how geometrically similar they are. We make this comparison by matching points in one persistence diagram with points in the other persistence diagram. Two such ways to measure the distance (as a single value!) between two persistence diagrams are the bottleneck distance and the Wasserstein distance.</p>
<p>Do we know that this distance is useful? We do, due to the stability theorem. This theorem proves that the distance between two persistence diagrams is less that the distance between the two corresponding datasets.</p>
<h3>degrees of freedom (what choices can we make)</h3>
<p>a. How do we draw the complex? Vietoris-Rips or something else?</p>
<p>b. How do we measure the distance between the points in the persistence diagram? Bottleneck distance? Wasserstein distance? etc.</p>

        <!--<div class="entry-content"> <h3>configuration</h3>
<p>Start the ssh agent (add this to your <code>~/.zshrc</code>, for example):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="k">$(</span>ssh-agent -s<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Add the following at the head of <code>~/.gitconfig</code> in order to specify a git configuration per path. These are called <em>conditional includes</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/path/work/&quot;]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">gitconfig-work</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">[includeIf &quot;gitdir:~/path/play/&quot;]</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">gitconfig-play</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Contents of <code>~/.gitconfig-work</code> or <code>~/.gitconfig-play</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">    </span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Add an <code>IdentityFile</code> to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> for each ssh key in use by git. It's reasonable practice to specify the host rather than use a wildcard:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-work
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-play
</code></pre></div>

<h3>debugging</h3>
<p>List the source of each git configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git config --list --show-origin
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unset credential helper:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git config --global --unset credential.helper
</code></pre></div>

<p>Show some in-scope git configurations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git config user.email
git config user.username
git config core.sshCommand
</code></pre></div>

<p>See the full debugs logs of ssh to determine exactly where it's finding ssh keys:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh -v
</code></pre></div>

<p>git uses your ssh key to identify you. Determine which user git is authenticating you as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh -o <span class="s2">&quot;IdentitiesOnly=yes&quot;</span> -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -T git@github.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>The combination of <code>-o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> may not always guarantee that you authenticate with the specified ssh key (there are may places ssh looks), but for my setup this works.</p> </div>--><!-- /.entry-content   not article.summary-->
